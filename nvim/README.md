# How to work

This requires the installation of `jedi-language-server`:

- `pip install -U jedi-language-server`

For Python formatting on `<F3>` and linting on `<F4>`, install (one of):

- `pip install -U ruff` (recommended; provides both `ruff format` and `ruff check`)
- `pip install -U black` (formatting only)

May need to fiddle with PATH to get it to work.
